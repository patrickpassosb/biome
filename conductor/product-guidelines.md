# Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice & Communication
- **Tone:** Professional & Scientific. Biome communicates with precision, utilizing data-backed language and biological terminology to build trust through expertise.
- **Persona:** The Analytical Scientist. The AI Agent acts as an objective, data-obsessed expert whose primary mission is to optimize gym performance. Every interaction is filtered through the lens of training physics and biological markers.

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Primary Aesthetic:** High-Tech "Laboratory" (Dark Mode). The interface uses deep blacks and slate grays with sharp cyan or electric blue accents to create a "command center" feel.
- **Core Interface:** Agent-First Design. The primary user experience is a narrative-driven "Command Center" where the AI Agent presents synthesized findings and coaching notes. High-density charts and raw data are secondary, providing supporting evidence for the Agent's insights.

## Strategic Pillars
- **Performance Integrity:** Every recommendation must be aimed at objective progress. We prioritize progressive overload (increasing weight, volume, or density) as the primary indicator of success.
- **Scientific Transparency:** The "Black Box" is forbidden. Biome must always expose the logic behind its coaching suggestions, showing the specific data trends (e.g., volume plateaus or RPE spikes) that triggered a change in the plan.
- **Biological Specificity:** We reject generic templates. All guidance must be rooted in the user's unique "Bio"—integrating biological markers, age, sex, and personal history into the coaching algorithm.
