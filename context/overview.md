#### **Welcome to the era of Gemini 3.**

Google DeepMind is thrilled to invite you to the Gemini 3 global hackathon. We are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do by enhancing reasoning capabilities, unlocking multimodal experiences and reducing latency. Now, we want to see what you can create with our most capable and intelligent model family to date.

Whether you are a seasoned AI engineer or writing your first line of code, this is your invitation to build the future. We are looking for more than just another chat interface. We want to see fun, creative, next-generation applications built with the Gemini 3 family

#### Why participate?

*   **Be First:** Get hands-on access to the Gemini 3 API before the rest of the world catches up.

*   **Build Something New:** This challenge is strictly for new applications. It’s a level playing field for everyone.

*   **Win Big:** We have a prize pool of $100,000 + interviews with the [AI Futures Fund](https://labs.google/aifuturesfund) team for an opportunity to fund your project.

### Requirements

#### What to Build

The prompt is simple: **Build a NEW application using the Gemini 3 API.** There are no category restrictions. Build a game, a productivity tool, a scientific analyzer, or a robotic controller. If it uses Gemini 3 to do something cool, we want to see it! For inspiration, check out the [Resources tab](https://gemini3.devpost.com/resources)!

#### What to Submit

*   Text description describing the Gemini Integration - A brief write-up (~200 words) detailing which Gemini 3 features were used and how they are central to the application.
*   Public Project Link: A URL to your working product or interactive demo. Consider using AI Studio apps, which are the fastest way to build prototypes using the Gemini API.
    *   _This allows judges to experience your project firsthand, if applicable. It should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall._

*   URL to your **PUBLIC** code repository - **required** if you do not have an AI Studio link to your project
*   ~3-minute demonstration video - judges may not watch beyond 3 minutes

See full [rules](https://gemini3.devpost.com/rules) for details.
